{"name":"Ebook-experiments","tagline":"ebook experiments","body":"# eBook Experiments\r\n\r\nThe following eBooks experiments are currently available.\r\n\r\n## Peter Pan\r\n\r\nA [full length book](https://github.com/caraya/ebook-experiments/blob/master/peter-pan/peter-pan-full.epub) with text and cover image provided by [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16).\r\n\r\nThe HTML was hand coded from the original text withCSS that tests some of CSS 2 and 3's pseudo elements and pseudo classes. It has only been tested in iBooks.\r\n\r\n> TODO:\r\n> Work on incorporating epub:type and WARIA roles to the book\r\n\r\n## Fixed Page Layout\r\n\r\nFixed layout example using pictures from the World Domination Summit in Portland, Oregon. Also incorporates video (no captions or transcripts yet)\r\n\r\n## Font Example Books\r\n\r\nUsing the first two chapters of Peter Pan (see above), with additional content tailored for testing, we test multiple open sourced fonts in different styles and weights to see which one looks best for which book. Because we want to test the font, so we will not subset them. This way you can crack the book open and use the fonts contained in it.\r\n\r\n* Original book without web fonts\r\n* Books using the following fonts\r\n    * Google Roboto\r\n    * Adobe Sourcecode Sans\r\n    * Adobe Sourcecode Pro\r\n    * DejaVu \r\n    * Gentium Plus\r\n    * Raleway\r\n    * Jura\r\n    * Goudy Bookletter\r\n    * Fira\r\n\r\nThe following fonts are under consideration\r\n\r\n* GrauBlau Sans\r\n* Alegreya\r\n* Benton Sans\r\n* Ubuntu font family\r\n* Calluna Sans\r\n* Bitstream Vera Sans\r\n* Junction\r\n* League Gothic\r\n* LindenHill\r\n* MGOpen Modata\r\n* Melbourne (Author was ok with my subsetting the font. Please ask for permission to do the same for your projects)\r\n* Chatype\r\n\r\n## Font subsetting comparison\r\n\r\nUsing Font Squirrel's Web Font Generator we'll subset Adobe's Sourcecode Sans and compare the size of the full font versus a Latin 1 subset.\r\n\r\nProcess, tools and results are discussed.\r\n\r\nDiscussed in my [blog](http://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/subsetting-fonts/)\r\n\r\n## Basic CSS for Ebooks\r\n\r\nThe SASS Files and resulting CSS used to create ebook stylesheets. I've chosen SASS because it allows more flexibility than plain CSS\r\n\r\n## Long form publishing\r\n\r\nHow far can we take technologies that are still in development and use them to create long-form content for the web?\r\n\r\n## ebook styleguide\r\n\r\nJust as with web sites/appps, we need to have a standard styleguide for ebooks. This is a first attempt at doing this and it's likely to be incomplete. Still it's a good starting point for others to improve on the idea and have samples to present to prospects :-)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
