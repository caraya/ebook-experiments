<div class="content">
  <p class='first'>It little profits that an idle king, </p>
  <p>By this still hearth, among these barren crags, </p>
  <p>Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole </p>
  <p>Unequal laws unto a savage race, </p>
  <p>That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. </p>
  <p>I cannot rest from travel: I will drink </p>
  <p>Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd </p>
  <p>Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those </p>
  <p>That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when </p>
  <p>Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades </p>
  <p>Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; </p>
  <p>For always roaming with a hungry heart </p>
  <p>Much have I seen and known; cities of men </p>
  <p>And manners, climates, councils, governments, </p>
  <p>Myself not least, but honour'd of them all; </p>
  <p>And drunk delight of battle with my peers, </p>
  <p>Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. </p>
  <p>I am a part of all that I have met; </p>
  <p>Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' </p>
  <p>Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades </p>
  <p>For ever and forever when I move. </p>
  <p>How dull it is to pause, to make an end, </p>
  <p>To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! </p>
  <p>As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life </p>
  <p>Were all too little, and of one to me </p>
  <p>Little remains: but every hour is saved </p>
  <p>From that eternal silence, something more, </p>
  <p>A bringer of new things; and vile it were </p>
  <p>For some three suns to store and hoard myself, </p>
  <p>And this gray spirit yearning in desire </p>
  <p>To follow knowledge like a sinking star, </p>
  <p>Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. </p>

  <p class="first">This is my son, mine own Telemachus, </p>
  <p>To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,&mdash; </p>
  <p>Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil </p>
  <p>This labour, by slow prudence to make mild </p>
  <p>A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees </p>
  <p>Subdue them to the useful and the good. </p>
  <p>Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere </p>
  <p>Of common duties, decent not to fail </p>
  <p>In offices of tenderness, and pay </p>
  <p>Meet adoration to my household gods, </p>
  <p>When I am gone. He works his work, I mine. </p>

  <p class="first">There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: </p>
  <p>There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners, </p>
  <p>Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me&mdash; </p>
  <p>That ever with a frolic welcome took </p>
  <p>The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed </p>
  <p>Free hearts, free foreheads&mdash;you and I are old; </p>
  <p>Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; </p>
  <p>Death closes all: but something ere the end, </p>
  <p>Some work of noble note, may yet be done, </p>
  <p>Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. </p>
  <p>The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: </p>
  <p>The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep </p>
  <p>Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, </p>
  <p>'T is not too late to seek a newer world. </p>
  <p>Push off, and sitting well in order smite </p>
  <p>The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds </p>
  <p>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths </p>
  <p>Of all the western stars, until I die. </p>
  <p>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: </p>
  <p>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, </p>
  <p>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. </p>
  <p>Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' </p>
  <p>We are not now that strength which in old days </p>
  <p>Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; </p>
  <p>One equal temper of heroic hearts, </p>
  <p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will </p>
  <p>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>
